# Supertext Translation for Pimcore

Translate Pimcore documents and data objects into your other languages with **Supertext AI**, right in Pimcore Studio.

Open a page or a data object, click **Translate with Supertext** in the toolbar, tick the languages and click **Translate**. Pages come back as unpublished, linked translations in each language's document tree; data objects get their localized fields filled in a new version. Editors review, adjust and publish as usual.

- Uses Pimcore's own languages, linked document translations and localized fields
- Translates page titles, descriptions, navigation names and the page's texts and link texts; HTML keeps its headings, bold text, links and lists
- New translations get keys (URLs) made from the translated navigation name
- Existing translations are kept unless the editor explicitly overwrites them; everything is saved as a draft or new version
- A permission *Translate with Supertext*; Pimcore's workspaces and language restrictions apply
- Formal or informal tone and custom Supertext language codes per language; console commands for scripts
